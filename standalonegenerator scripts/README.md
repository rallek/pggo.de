This scripts are made for Windows machines.

You have to make your powershell capable to run PowerShell Scripts. See e.g.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6920399/powershell-is-initially-disabled-why-might-a-cautious-admin-argue-to-leave-it-d/6920542#6920542

As this is my very first PS I am happy for any input for improvements.

Have fun!
