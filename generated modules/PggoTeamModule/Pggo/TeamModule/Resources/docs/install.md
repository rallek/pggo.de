# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy PggoTeamModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/Pggo/TeamModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate PggoTeamModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/PggoTeamModule/` to `/userdata/PggoTeamModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/PggoTeamModule/` writable including all sub folders.
